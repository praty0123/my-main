The capacity to predict insurance claims in the quickly changing healthcare insurance market is essential for managing financial risks and maximizing operational effectiveness. The objective of this project is to predict whether or not an health insurance claim will be
made by utilizing the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). It is necessary to plan a strategy that gets around these challenges because the dataset has inherent complexity due to a lack of samples and a small imbalance. Getting a thorough grasp of the dataset, evaluating its quality, and cleaning it up Is needed to guarantee the accuracy of
the analysis that follows are all part of the first phase of the project. In order to prepare the dataset for predictive modelling, data pre-processing is essential. This entails
transforming and manipulating data to improve its relevance and quality. To make sure the model is trained on the most pertinent data, feature selection and extraction techniques
are used to determine the most influential variables. The predictive modelling phase employs various classification algorithms to build a robust model capable of discerning whether an insurance claim is likely. Hyperparameter tuning is implemented to optimize the performance of these algorithms, and thorough evaluation metrics are employed to compare their effectiveness. The challenge of an imbalanced dataset is addressed through specialized techniques to ensure that the model does not compromise on its predictive accuracy. Overall, the project not only aims to provide a predictive model for Health Insurance Claim anticipation. The outcomes of this endeavour hold the potential to revolutionize how healthcare insurance companies approach claim anticipation, enhancing their decision- making processes and ultimately contributing to a more efficient and sustainable healthcare ecosystem.
